# PreCDA
## Introduction
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous noncoding RNAs. Emerging evidence has shown that circRNAs can be a novel biomarker or therapeutic target for many diseases. Therefore, identifying potential disease-related circRNAs is helpful in improving the efficiency of finding therapeutic targets for diseases. Here, a computational model (PreCDA) is proposed to predict potential circRNA-disease associations.
